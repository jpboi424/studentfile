            <p> 
                I am going to SMU to become a backend developer as a career change.
                I am fairly new to programming with only one web development class taken freshman year in high school.
                During my leisure time, I enjoy spending time with my family including my newborn baby Sophia, at 10 months old, playing pool, and watching sports.
